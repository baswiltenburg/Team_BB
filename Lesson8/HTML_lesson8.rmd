## Welcome to the report of the results of Team BB 

This report shows the **results** of the excersice in lesson 8. 
In this excersice we have learned about the following applications: 

* - How to extract information from matrixes, dataframes and rasterlayers;*
* - How to modify and add information to matrixes, dataframes and rasterlayers;*
* - How to create linear regressoin models;*
* - How to use the results of a linear regression model;*
* - How to do zonal analysis;*
* - How to use and set-up .rmd files and create a .HTML for showing or presenting your results*

The goal of this assignment was to set up a linear regression model and calculate a vcf-parameter out of all spectral bands of the Landsat 7 sattelite. 
In the end, we compared the known vcf-parameter with the predicted vcf-parameter, coming from the linear regression model. We did these comparison both on the whole raster-image and on the specified classes "wetland", "forest" and "cropland". The comparison is in terms of **root means square error**.


# Step 1: Create scatterplots
In the first step we create scatters plots of all spectral bands against the known vcf-parameters. From these scatter plots, you can draw a conclusion about the corrolation and importance of a single band and the known vcf-parameter. All scatterplots are shown in the image below:

**All bands plotted against the vcf-parameter**

![Corrolatoin between bands and VCF](output/scatterplots.png)

The conclusion we can draw from this scatterplot, is that all single sprectral bands are not really corrolated with the VCF. Therefore we expect that all bands will show a rather equeal importance-factor in the linear regression model. 


# Step 2: Linear regression model to predict VCF
The second step was to set up a linear regression model. This linear regression model calculates a parameter for each single spectral band. These parameter describes the importance of each single band with respect to the VCF. 

**The vcf is calculated with the following function:**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
estimate_VCF <- function(dataframe){
  vcf_model <- lm(VCF ~ band1 + band2 + band3 + band4 + band5 + band7, data=dataframe)
  cols <- c("orange", "dark green", "light blue")
  vcf_predict <- predict(Gewata, model=vcf_model, na.rm=TRUE, col = cols)
  vcf_predict[vcf_predict < 0] <- NA
  vcf_predict[vcf_predict > 100] <- NA
  values_vcf_predict <- getValues(vcf_predict)
  dataframe$predicted_VCF <- values_vcf_predict
  result <- list(vcf_predict, values_vcf_predict, vcf_model)
  return(result)
}
```

The results of this linear regresion model are presented in the table below. The results show that all the 6 spectral bands are of big importance with respect to the VCF. This can also be explained by the scatter plots, where all bands show a uncorrolated relation.  

**Results linear regression model**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(vcf_model)
```


# Step 3: Present the predicted vcf-factor according to the linear regression model
Both the predicted vcf-parameters (coming from the linear regression model) and the known vcf-parameters are presented in the images below.

**The known vcf-parameter**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(Gewata$VCF)
```

**The predicted vcf-parameter according to the regression model**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(vcf_predict)
```


# Step 4: Calculate the root mean square error of the whole image
In step 4, we calculate the root mean square of the whole image. These is calulated by the following code:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
rmse_general <- function(predict, real){
  vcf_predict_DF <- as.data.frame(predict)
  names(vcf_predict_DF) <- c("predicted_vcf")
  Gewata_VSF_DF <- as.data.frame(real)
  names(Gewata_VSF_DF) <- c("real_vcf")
  rmse_general <- sqrt(mean((vcf_predict_DF$predicted_vcf - Gewata_VSF_DF$real_vcf)^2 , na.rm = TRUE))
  return(rmse_general)
}
```

**The general RMSE**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(rmse_general1)
```


# Step 5: Calculate the root mean square error per class
The calculate the root mean square error per class, we first rasterize the class polygons and gave it proper names and colors. 
After that, the script below shows how the root mean square error per class is calculated. We have used the zonal application for this. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
rmse_per_class <- function(predict, real){
  trainingPoly@data$Code <- as.numeric(trainingPoly@data$Class)
  classes <- rasterize(trainingPoly, predict, field='Code')
  cols <- c("orange", "dark green", "light blue")
  # plot(classes, col=cols, legend=FALSE)
  names(predict) <- "vcf_predicted"
  difference_VCF <- predict - real
  power2_difference_VCF <- difference_VCF^2
  zonal_mean <- zonal(power2_difference_VCF, classes, fun="mean", na.rm=TRUE)
  zonal_mean_DF <- as.data.frame(zonal_mean)
  zonal_rmse<- sqrt(zonal_mean)
  zonal_rmse_DF <- as.data.frame(zonal_rmse)
  zonal_rmse_DF$zone <- zonal_mean_DF$zone
  names(zonal_rmse_DF) <- c("class", "RMSE")
  zonal_rmse_DF$class_name <- unique(trainingPoly@data$Class)
  return(zonal_rmse_DF)
}
```

**The RMSE per class**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(rmse_per_class1)
```

The table above shows the final results of the root mean square error for different classes.
